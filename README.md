Here's my library of Python programming practices on InterviewBit.
Besides the solution coding, I also write explanation articles in Chinese, since I'm from Taiwan, to try talking through the core concepts of every interview questions.

Hope you find some useful or inspiring and please feel free to let me know if there are any mistakes on the codes or explanations. Happy Coding :)
